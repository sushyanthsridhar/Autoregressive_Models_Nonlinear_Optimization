# Autoregressive_Models_Nonlinear_Optimization

This paper addresses the environmental issues associated with the Ganesh Chaturthi festival in Mumbai, specifically focusing on pollution caused by idol immersion. The study proposes the use of a deterministic mixed-integer programming model and demand forecasting techniques to optimize idol production, with efforts to incorporate eco-friendly materials like terracotta. The analysis involves de-seasonalizing demand for idols over the past six years using the Box-Jenkins method to improve forecasting and resource management.
